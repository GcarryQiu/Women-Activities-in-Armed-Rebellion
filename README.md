# Women Activities in Armed Rebellion

## Overview

This repo contains an analysis of women’s logistical participation in rebel organizations using the Women’s Activities in Armed Rebellion (WAAR) dataset (1946–2015). A logistic regression model is used to study whether rebel groups with women in leadership positions are more likely to have women participating in logistical roles, controlling for coalition membership and the presence of women’s wings.
