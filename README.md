# Women-Activities-in-Armed-Rebellion
This project uses the Women’s Activities in Armed Rebellion (WAAR) dataset, which documents women’s participation in over 370 rebel organizations (1946–2015). The data include 22 measures covering women’s roles in non-combat, combat, and leadership activities. The purpose of this project is to analyze how and why rebel groups vary in their inclusion of women, and what these patterns imply for conflict dynamics and organizational behavior. All coding descriptions and contextual information are provided in the WAAR Handbook and the associated open-access article in Journal of Peace Research.
